# Personal-Budget-I

## About Me

I'm currently a beginner student at Codecademy, taking my first steps into the world of programming.  This was my first real project starting from a blank slate and at first felt overwhelming with many concepts I didn't know how to tackle.  Through many errors and Google/Bing searches I was able to work my way through small piece by small piece and along the way found myself slowly picking up concepts being utilized.  Can't wait until the next project as I found that the more I learned, the more I learned how much more I need to learn.

## Concept

This was created for a Codecademy lesson project to practice API calls as well as git commands.  The idea was to represent "Envelope Budgeting" in the digital world, where every cash is distributed into envelopes for different spending categories.  The local session starts out with a default set of envelopes and wallet.  From the wallet you can either add funds (paycheck) or distribute funds into each envelope by their budgeted amount.  With each individual envelope they can be added, deleted, adjusted for a different budget, withdrawn for spending, or have funds transferred to another envelope.

## Future Improvements

I attemped this project using a minimal amount of "hints" from project guide until I got everything working.  After reviewing their hints, there are definitely better ways I could have written the API calls to simplify the code.  There are also a few repeated snippets of code I know can be rewritten as helper functions.
